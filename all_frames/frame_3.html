         <h1> <u><font face="Courier">ABOUT US</font></u></h1>
</p>
Christ School, a premier educational institution in Bangalore, blossomed out of the educational vision of Carmelites of Mary 
Immaculate, the first indigenous religious congregation, which founded at Mannanam, Kerala, India, on 11 May 183, by St. Kuriakose 
Elias Chavara, the great educationalist and social reformer.<br><br>

Christ school was founded in June 1984, with about hundred students and six teachers. The then Rector of Dharmaram College, Rev. Fr.
Justin Koyipuram blessed the school building on 3rd June 1984 in the presence of parents and well-wishers.<br><br>

The idea of a school, with reference to the request by the general public, especially the Christian minority of the locality, was
 approved by the governing body meeting of Christ Educational Society held on 7th September 1983 at Dharmaram College. The matter 
 was entrusted to Rev. Fr. Benedict CMI and Rev. Fr. John Marius CMI. Their hard work paved the way for the development of the 
 school into an outstanding institution.The first SSLC batch of 41 students came out in flying colours in March 1990 under the able
guidance of the founding Principal Rev. Fr. John Marius CMI.<br><br>

At Christ, the students are encouraged to be creative, reflective, and value based motivated learners. Individual talents of the 
children are spotted, nourished and encouraged. Along with rigorous academic programme, training in a variety of co-curricular 
activities empowers the students with a holistic education, preparing them to be successful leaders for better tomorrow. Christ 
School has a glorious track record in the field of academics and co-curricular activities with quality education. Christ School 
inculcates firm discipline and emphasizes genuine values.
